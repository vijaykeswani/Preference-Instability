## Kidney Allocation Moral Preference Stability and Prediction Analysis

This repository contains analysis of the data collected using the kidney allocation project. Participants were provided with several pairwise comparisons of kidney patients and asked to decide which of the presented patients should receive an available kidney. The complete details of the data collection process are provided in the reference below,

The notebook `stability_analysis.ipynb` contains details of the analysis of the response stability of the recruited participants. This also contains the code used for the results in the AIES 2024 paper ***"On The Stability of Moral Preferences: A Problem with Computational Elicitation Methods"***.

The notebook `prediction_analysis.ipynb` contains details of the prediction analysis over the kidney allocation data.
